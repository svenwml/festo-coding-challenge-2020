The link to the "screen" is wrong, so manually address it:

In the picture, we can see a note on the monitor giving the first part (fin-der-) of a github account. In the "mouse and keyboard" picture, we can find the second part (lohn).

So we have a hint to the github account "fin-der-lohn". This user has a repository "coding-challenge2020" which only contains a readme-file. The latest commit does not provide any useful information but there is another commit which provides the solution. The solution is 1337potato.
